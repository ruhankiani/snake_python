# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game built using Python and Pygame. The game provides a classic snake experience where the player navigates a growing snake to collect food while avoiding collisions.

## Features

- Classic snake game mechanics
- Food spawns randomly on the screen
- Score tracking system
- Smooth snake movement with arrow keys
- Restart functionality upon game over
- Wrap-around movement (snake appears on the opposite side when crossing boundaries)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame library

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python installed, then install Pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the game:**

   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. Use the following arrow keys to control the snake:
   - `LEFT` to move left
   - `RIGHT` to move right
   - `UP` to move up
   - `DOWN` to move down

2. Collect food items (red blocks) to increase your score and the length of the snake.
3. Avoid running into yourself.
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
5. Press `C` to restart the game after a game over or `Q` to quit.

## Scoring

- Each food collected increases the score by 10 points.
- The current score is displayed at the top-left corner of the screen.


## Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for food collection and game over events.
- Implement difficulty levels with increasing speed.
- Enhance graphics with better sprites and animations.
